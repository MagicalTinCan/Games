Install C/C++ extension
Install C/C++ extension pack

MSYS2 (Minimal System 2)
Install MSYS2 so VSCode can run C++
add C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin to path by doing setx path "%path%;C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin;" (remove the first ; if path already has a ; at the end, not doing so will make the system check for something that dont exist)
open MSYS2
run pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
hit enter when it asks for a selection, it will default and install all
enter Y for yes
wait for installation
exit

Go to VSCode
Try to run your code, if it asks for a compiler tell it any of these: gdb, gcc, or g++
Try to run your code again twice. The first time you run it, it will throw up a bunch of text, just run it again.

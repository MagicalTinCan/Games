To play the game, run main.exe
Don't shove the code into an editor, it (probably) wont work.

If the program isn't working, try checking if you meet these conditions:
your computer has python.exe installed and is in the path folder
    (you can check if its in the path folder by opening command prompt and typing in python and it doesnt throw some sort of error)
your computer has git.exe installed and is in the path folder
    (you can check by doing the same thing as with checking python.exe)
the main.exe file is still in the folder with the rest of the code. if its taken out, it WILL break.
you are connected to the internet
    (if you are not then the git tool which uses to save/load into your game account which is located on a github server simply wont work)
your folder contains every single essential file from download
    essential files are:
        main.exe
        main.cpp
        sokoban.cpp
        data.h
        files.h
        item.h
        initializeData.py
        pull.bat
        upload.bat
        clearTheDamnScreen.bat
